      <description>Bans for tackles and bumps are the talk of the town, causing outrage from fantasy football coaches and old bogans alike.
I have created a Dataset of AFL Bans (DAB) for use in analysis.
From Round 1 to Round 6 we have seen 18 players banned for offences ranging from bumps, strikes to tackles.
The majority of bans coming from tackles and bumps, with a minority from strikes
Clustering of midfielders, looking like strong correlation between number of tackles and potential to be banned for tackling.</description>

      <description>I am an idiot who likes to write make silly little charts about footy.
I hope you can enjoy them as much as I enjoy making them.
Hopefully I&amp;rsquo;ll upload some of my old footy emails here when I have time.
Sorry some of them are very cursed.
One of the silly little charts even made it on the Alan Kohler&amp;rsquo;s Finance report.</description>
